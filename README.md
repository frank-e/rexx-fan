*Stand-alone Rexx tools: ooRexx or Regina not limited to Windows NT*

[Rexx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexx) is a script language used by IBM operating systems and related products, e.g., [XEDIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XEDIT), PC DOS and OS/2. Rexx has been ported to other platforms including Windows and Linux. Rexx is used as a macro language in, e.g., the XEDIT clones Kedit and [THE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hessling_Editor).

As a macro language Rexx could be compared with [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) or [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)), and as a programming language Rexx could be compared with [AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK) or [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). Classic Rexx influenced [NetRexx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetRexx), a dialect for the Java virtual machine, and [ooRexx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_REXX), an object oriented extension.

The scripts in this repo are supposed to work in command line windows (**cmd.exe** shells) on Windows 2000 or later with *ooRexx* or *Regina*, and as long as they do not use special features such as hardlinks they could still/also work on OS/2 or Linux. Untested, check the usual suspects such as backslashes or semicolons instead of slashes or colons on Linux.
